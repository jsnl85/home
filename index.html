							<p>João was a phenomenal asset to Storm either leading or significantly contributing to some major projects during his 5 years. His deep knowledge of the Microsoft stack and specifically SharePoint provided tremendous value to both customers and Storm alike. He has a rare ability of identifying and implementing technical solutions to complex business problems in a measured and thoughtful manner that resonates with both technical and business leaders in organisations. He puts in the hard yards yet remains always helpful and patient, especially with demanding sales guys!</p>

							<p>During his time in Storm (almost 5 years), João was one of the most senior and trusted members of the SharePoint Development team. His work as a Solution Architect in a range of projects was always very well received and he was able to build long lasting and trusting relationships with all the customers he worked with. His contribution to the internal team was fundamental as well; he was always available to mentor and help junior staff solving problems and had a major contribution in establishing the team's best practices and frameworks. His dedication, communication and technical abilities make him a key member for any team and I hope I can work with João again in the future!</p>
